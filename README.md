The assignment's objective is to develop a high-precision numeric calculator capable of handling 
very large integers, beyond the capabilities of standard int and double data types in C. 
This project emphasizes the application of arrays, strings, functions, and the typedef facility, without 
reliance on dynamic memory allocation or file operations.
